The app that we are createing is a crossplatform app working for both android and apples devices . We've been approached by Christoffel a private chef and he's asking for a menu app that will allow him to select from 
a list of meal what he will be preparing and also allow him to enter different others dishes he would like to add to the menus 
In this part2 , we created a single file where we put a form the chef to enter the details of menus (Dish name ,Description,Price,Category).
There is also the different menus selection that the user can choose and add to the item added by a button
